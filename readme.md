# 📚 DSA Learning Log

Welcome to my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** learning log!  
This repository contains concise notes, time complexities, space complexities, and code snippets for DSA concepts.  
The aim is to develop a solid problem-solving foundation for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## 🕒 Time & Space Complexity

### ✅ What is Time Complexity?
Time complexity defines **how the execution time of an algorithm grows with respect to the input size** `N`.

- It measures the **rate at which time taken increases w.r.t input size**.
- Interviewers prioritize understanding **time complexity** over code quality during interviews.
- Assume the **worst-case scenario**, unless specified otherwise.

### ✅ Big-O Notation
Big-O describes the **upper bound (worst-case)** performance of an algorithm, abstracting away constants and less significant terms.

> Example:  
> If an algorithm runs in `3N` time, the complexity is **O(N)**.  
> Ignore constants while writing time complexity.

## ⏱️ Common Time Complexities

| Complexity | Description                                    | Example Algorithms                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| O(1)       | Constant time                                  | Accessing an element in an array         |
| O(log N)   | Logarithmic time                               | Binary Search                            |
| O(N)       | Linear time                                    | Linear Search                            |
| O(N log N) | Log-linear time                                | Merge Sort, Heap Sort                    |
| O(N²)      | Quadratic time                                 | Nested loops, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort|
| O(2^N)     | Exponential time                               | Recursion without memoization (Fibonacci)|
| O(N!)      | Factorial time                                 | Permutations (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem) |

## 💾 Space Complexity
Space complexity refers to **the extra space (auxiliary space)** an algorithm requires, **excluding input size**.

- Includes space used by **variables, data structures, and the call stack**.
- An optimized algorithm uses **minimal auxiliary space**.

---

## ⚡ Key Notes
- Always **optimize for time complexity** before space complexity (unless stated otherwise).
- Avoid modifying input data directly if it's used elsewhere.
- **Time complexity** reflects **scalability**, crucial for large input sizes.
